#9 1.510 ERROR: Cannot install aiobotocore==2.7.0 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.
#9 1.510 
#9 1.510 The conflict is caused by:
#9 1.510     The user requested aiobotocore==2.7.0
#9 1.510     The user requested (constraint) aiobotocore==2.26.0

#9 1.510     aiobotocore
#9 1.510 
#9 1.510 To fix this you could try to:
#9 1.510 1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
#9 1.510 2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
